## Key Features of the Analysis

- **Medal Distribution**: Analysis of gold, silver, and bronze medal winners across different sports and countries.
- **Athlete Statistics**: Exploration of the relationship between athletes' height and weight and their performance in the Games.
- **Country Performance**: Evaluation of how various countries have grown in terms of sports participation and medal achievements over time.
  
## Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: Used for data manipulation and analysis (`pandas`, `NumPy`).
- **Streamlit**: For creating an interactive user interface for visualizing the EDA results.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: For plotting visualizations and insights.

## Visualizations

Some of the visualizations generated include:

- Medal tally for top-performing countries.
- Trends in country-wise performance over time.
- Relationship between athletes' height, weight, and their performance outcomes.
